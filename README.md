# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is Ross

A visual systems thinker that likes to understand how things work under the hood. Check out [rossmoody.com](https://rossmoody.com/) for a fun list of my side projects and favorite things.

## ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on...

My open source side project called [SVG Gobbler](https://github.com/rossmoody/svg-gobbler). It's a browser extension that finds vector content in the page and lets you download it or copy it to your clipboard for quick access during development and design.
